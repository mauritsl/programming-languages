This project analyses the StackOverflow survey data to find trends in the usage of programming languages. It was done as part of Udacity's Data Science Nano Degree course.

## Questions answered

* Which programming languages are popular in 2022?
* Who is using these languages?
* Will ‘hobby languages’ be used in the professional environment later on?

## Files

* `programming_languages.ipynb` contains the Python notebook containing all steps and further explanation for this analysis
* `output/*.dot` are the outputs from the decision trees
* `output/*.pdf` are the rendered outputs
* `trees/*.dot` are readable trees manually created based on the decision trees
* `trees/*.pdf` are their rendered outputs

## Used libraries

The following libraries are required to run the notebook:

* matplotlib
* numpy
* pandas
* scipy
* seaborn
* sklearn

Data is not included in this repository but can be downloaded from [StackOverflow](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey).
